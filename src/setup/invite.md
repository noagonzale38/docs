# Inviting The Bot  
***

# NOTE: THIS IS FOR WHITELISTED CSRP MAFIAS, OFFICIAL SERVERS, AND DEPARTMENTS.

**NOTE: If you bought premium, check the patreon posts for the invite. If not, dm [noagonzale38](https://discord.com/users/1213915425369227334)
  
You'll first be asked to select the server you want to add the Tickets bot. 
> **Note:** you must have the **Manage Server** permission to do this.  

![Select server](../img/invite-1.webp)

Upon pressing `Continue`, you'll be presented with a list of permissions Tickets is asking for. It is important that you allow the bot all of these permissions to ensure successful operation. However, you *are* able to remove the Administrator permission if you so wish, but please make sure you do not have any deny permission overrides applied to roles the bot has (including @everyone) on your channel categories. 

Click `Authorize` to proceed.

![Authorize permissions](../img/invite-2.webp)

Discord will then present you with a screen stating that you've authorised the bot: it's now in your server! 

If you need the bot to be in a language other than English, learn more [here](./languages.md).

If not, let's start configuring the bot: [Bot Configuration](./configuration.md)
